# Work-during-the-student-period
Hi! I decided to upload the projects I made while I was at university. Of course, I decided to upload them late, and I've already lost many of them. I don't know why I didn't upload everything to GitHub right away, but it's better late than never. Now, I'll keep in mind to upload everything to GitHub before it gets lost on my desktop.
